# DEPRECATED :skull:

The PR [441](https://github.com/jneen/rouge/pull/441) has been merged :tada: so this repository is not needed anymore.

Use [rouge](https://github.com/jneen/rouge) instead.

# Rouge::Lexers::Crystal

[Crystal](https://crystal-lang.org) lexer for [rouge](http://rouge.jneen.net/).
